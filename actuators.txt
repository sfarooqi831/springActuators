** There is BuildInfoContributor which will show you the build related detials. we just need to define the build-  info goal.
 - There are three ways to play info
   * Using static data
   * Using POM file
   * Using Custom Contributor  [ Need to implment the InfoContributor (I)]
---
  if we want to create our own end_point we need to define one class and annotate with @Endpoint 
  we can only give one value as payload it doesn't support the complex payload.
  For path varibale we use the @Selector and for CRUD Operations [ @ReadOperation , @WriteOperation , @DeleteOperation]
